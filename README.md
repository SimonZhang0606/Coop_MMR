# Co-op MMR

Co-op MMR is a place for University of Waterloo students to look up and compare co-op jobs.

Currently, the code here supports only the Browse Jobs page (Feature 4 in the report).

## Data Scraping and Generation

1. Ensure all required dependencies have been installed by running `pip3 install -r sql_scripts/requirement.txt`.
1. Run `sql_scripts/linkedin_scraper`. It should take less than two hours for the script to run. The scraped data are stored in the `data` folder.

## Quick Start with Docker

This is the quickest and easiest way to get everything set up â€“ all you need to install is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

> Unfortunately, Docker does not run on all systems. Follow [Getting Started without Docker](#getting-started-without-docker) if you cannot install Docker.

1. Run `docker compose up`.
1. Visit http://localhost:5000/jobs to see the demo endpoint in action.
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the demo frontend in action.

To look into the database, visit http://localhost:8080/?server=db&username=root&db=coop_mmr to check out the DB in Adminer. When prompted for a login, use the username `root` and password `ThankMrGoose`.

## Getting Started without Docker

### Creating and Populating DB

1. Go to the `sql_scripts` folder.
1. Run `mysql -u root appDB < ./create_tables.sql` to create the table schemas.
1. Run `mysql -u root appDB < ./populate_tables.sql` to populate the tables with production data.

### Web App

1. Go to the `web` folder.
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `npm start`.

### Web Server

1. Go to the `server` folder.
1. _Optional, but recommended_: Set up and activate a [Python virtual envrionment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
1. Go to the `src` folder inside `server`.
1. Set the environment variables outlined in [Web Server Configuration](#web-server-configuration).
1. Run `python -m flask run --port=5000`.
